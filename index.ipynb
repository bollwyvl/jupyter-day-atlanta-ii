It does not reflect the opinions of any members of that community other than myself.\n",

Move the rightmost one back and forth, and parts of the graph will hide/appear, roughly based on time (until roughly now). Move the first one... and you'll see the start date move, but that can get really crazy, and I haven't figured out how to use it. \n",

    "By watching the graph and titles evolve, and exploring specific regions, I hope you can come away with more understanding than a pure text narrative or a static image... and since you can edit the graph yourself (`Open With ► Editor_`) with a live preview, perhaps you can discover or tell something yourself with the [GraphViz language](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/index.html)."
